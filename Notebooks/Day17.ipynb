    "# Day 17: Trick Shot\n",
    "* Peak height seems like an easy calculation as the upward velocity just drops by 1 each step and once we hit zero it wont go higher.\n",
    "* Part 1 only cares about Peak Y that'll still hit so I really don't even need to care about X at this time.\n",
    "* The hit tests is a little more involved but seems also pretty straight forward\n",
    "    * Basically we know that X will trend toward 0 and then settle there from either direction, so we can easily calculate if X will ever make it to our target and if it does, how many steps it'll take. For now we'll assume our X velocity will always be positive.\n",
    "    * For Y, our gravity constant is 1 which makes this easier. In other words we don't even need to check steps per say as Y will always hit 0 again before going negative. I.E, if our initial velocity is 2, our velocity over time will be 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> -1 -> -2 -> -3 -> -4 etc. This means our points after origin will be 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -3 -> -7 etc. In this case it'd take 5 steps to be back to y=0 and then start dropping.\n",
    "        * If initial velocity is 3 then we get 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> -1 -> -2 -> -3 -> -4, and 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 0 -> -4. That's 7 steps til touching origin again and our velocity from there is essentially -(1+v). \n",
    "        * Thought it may not matter, we can calculate the steps lost in upward velocity before we hit origin again by doing 2v+1\n",
    "        * So this is an easier calculation as we know our upward cancels in proportion to our start and from then provides us with an initial downward velocity to begin calculating for target breach. Which then simply becomes the same exercise as what we do for X"
